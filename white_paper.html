			<p>The 7 Pillars for the democratization of wealth under this innovative proposal are a 180-degree turn in society through education, good practices, transparency, efficient management, continuous improvement, balance with the environment, respect institutions.</p>
			<p>We live in a society, and several aspects are necessary to create wealth. If we all create wealth together, why is it not distributed in a better way? It is correct that those who work the most get more for their work. However, with many profits over few hands, the inequality created causes social problems. Charities, foundations (NGOs), and subsidies would not be necessary if a more equitable distribution of resources were not equal but proportional. </p>
			<p>This would also avoid tax evasion and tax havens. If natural resources belong to everyone, why is the benefit only for a few? </p>	
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>Likewise, the air, the seas, and the weather are the same for everyone?<br>
			The market and supply, as well as demand, indeed determine prices, but in 1776 Adam Smith argued that an invisible hand was the one who moved the markets to obtain their efficiency; that invisible hand in many cases of manipulation has names and surnames.</p>
			<p>Through the use of the tools of the capitalist system (in which we live despite everything) and the use of blockchain technology, Dow7Coin is born, a global bet for the financing of projects for the benefit of wealth creators and for the increase of the value of startups (a nascent company of great value and ability to withstand change), companies, artisans, industrialists, farmers, and professionals. A new concept, without borders or partisan policies (according to the interests of a few), is a disruptive proposal to change the status quo from society to the benefit of society.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h2 class="titulo-1">1876 (2.1% contraction)</h2>
		<p>he recession of 1876 was due to the so-called Panic of 1873, a severe financial crisis that caused a depression in North America and Europe that lasted until 1879. Among its many causes are American inflation, rampant speculative investments (predominantly in the world rail boom), the silver demonetization in the United States and Germany, and the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871).</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h2 class="titulo-1">1885 (0.02% contraction)</h2>
		<p>
			The contraction of the global economy in 1885 is directly related to the American recession that lasted from 1882 to 1885. At 38 months, it was the third-largest recession in the United States, after the Great Depression of 1929 and the Great Depression of 1873. In May 1884, the collapse of a brokerage, Grant & Ward, caused a widespread crash in the nation's stock market, severely hitting the American economy.

		<h2 class="titulo-1">1893 (0.8% contraction).</h2>
		<p>The crisis of 1893 was a severe economic depression in the United States that ended in 1897, profoundly affecting all sectors of the economy and unleashing political problems. For the first time, the level of unemployment in the United States exceeded 10% for more than half a decade. It is worth remembering that the period that lasted from 1873 to 1879 or 1896 (depending on the metric used) was dubbed as the 'Great Depression' and kept that name until the other Great Depression of 1930. It mainly affected Europe and the United States. Although it was a period of economic contraction and widespread deflation, it was not as severe as the financial crisis of 1930.</p>

		<h2 class="titulo-1">1908 (3% contraction).</h2>
		<p>The panic of 1907 was the first global financial crisis of the 20th century, only exceeded in severity by the Great Depression of 1930. This recession created an important legacy, as it spurred the currency reform movement that led to the establishment of the Federal Reserve of the United States central bank. Economists argue that the lessons of the 1907 panic changed how New York bankers perceived the importance of a central bank because panic was installed primarily among trust companies, institutions that competed with banks for deposits.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h2 class="titulo-1">1914 (6.7% contraction). </h2>
		<p> The recession of 1914 coincided with the beginning of the First World War. Economists say that this contraction, although severe, was overshadowed and forgotten by another crisis, the diplomatic one, which caused the first global conflict in history. As confrontation grew increasingly imminent, fear in global markets triggered a major financial panic.</p>

		<h2 class="titulo-1">1930-1932 (17.6% contraction). </h2>

			Considered the worst economic recession of the capitalist system of the 20th century, the Great Depression, also known as the Crisis of 1929, began that year with the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange.Several countries in the world suffered the devastating effects of this financial cataclysm.

		<p>The recession began in 1937 during the recovery from the Great Depression."Conventional economic responses to a recession are not going to work until people can safely get back to work" - Paul Romer, Nobel economist.US real GDP fell by 10%, unemployment declined considerably after 1933 and reached 20%, and industrial production contracted 32%. Children were used in protests to demand work, highlighting social desperation.</p>

		<h2 class="titulo-1">1908 (3% contraction).</h2>
		<p>The recession of 1945-1946 was the direct result of the postwar period. The conflict, which involved more than 70 countries, caused severe damage to the world economy, particularly Europe and the United States.</p>

		<h2 class="titulo-1">1975 (0.8% contraction). </h2>
		<img src="ing/wp/contraction.png" alt="contraction">
		<p>The recession of the early 1980s was a severe economic crisis that affected much of the developed world in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
		<p>
			Its effects were not as long-lasting in the United States and Japan, but high unemployment continued to affect other OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries until at least 1985. 
		</p>	
		<p>
			Its origins date back to the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis. Until then, it was the deepest recession since the postwar period.

		</p>
		<h2 class="titulo-1">1975 (0.8% contraction). 1991 (0.3% contraction).
			<p>
				
				The recession of the early 1990s affected much of the Western world. It is believed to have been caused by tight monetary policy enacted by central banks, primarily in response to concerns about inflation, loss of consumer and business confidence.
			</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>Those factors resulted from the oil price shock in 1990, the end of the Cold War and the subsequent drop in defense spending, the savings and loan crisis, and the drop-in office construction as a result of over-construction in the 1980s</p>
		<p>The international economic scenario has undergone significant changes since the 1990s, in which the phenomenon of globalization began to emerge, which,influenced by technological and computerized modernization, affected the production dynamics of companies and, therefore, the behavior of companies markets worldwide gave rise to a new international economic order. In this new context, countries become more interconnected, being the world market and its new rules, which began to regulate all kinds of commercial relations between nations. The Latin American economy was not left out of these new changes, suffering in many cases the effects of crises produced in other states.</p>

		<p>Most developed economies were in a recession, emerging countries suffered a proportionately much less impact. By way of comparison, in 2009, the US GDP fell by 2.5% while the Brazilian, by 0.1%. The following year, Brazil registered a resounding growth of 7.5%.</p>
		<h2 class="titulo-1">2020 (6.2% contraction). </h2>
		<p>According to the World Bank, the world economy is expected to shrink by more than 5% due to the covid-19 pandemic.
			The new virus, which originated in China, forced most countries to implement strong measures to restrict the movement of people. <br>
			With populations limited by fear of saturation of health systems, economic exchanges were severely hampered. "Current forecasts suggest that the global coronavirus recession will be the deepest since World War II, with most economies experiencing declines in GDP per capita since 1870," said economists Ayhan Kose and Naotaka Sugawara on the blog from the World Bank.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Promote inflation: </strong>As a result of its free-market reforms, this inflation can promote the world's inflation and result in an international trade that is state-dominated.</p>

		CRYPTOCURRENCY
	</h2>

	<p>In simple words, we all live in a digital world where different transactions are executed on the internet. In the past years, investors have shown excitement about this option because it allows them to work conveniently. Secondly, with the abundance of online investment options, they can rest assured about making varying choices. If you are reading this as a prospective investor, then this is the right place for you.</p>
	<p> Secondly, if you have been sifting through different articles in line with online payments, you must have been familiar with the concept of "cryptocurrency." Understand that cryptocurrency is a totality of virtual currencies that are secured with cryptography. You should also note that notes about cryptocurrency cannot be overspent or counterfeited. Because digital currency is decentralized, each transaction on the blockchain is stored in blocks of computers. This currency provides the privilege of anonymity, which means people will use it for transactions only when they are repulsed by the government or the third party's interference.</p>

	<p> With the global popularity of virtual currency, there has been an exponential increase in the concept of cryptocurrency investment. With just a few compelling reasons, experts have claimed that cryptocurrency is here to stay. Therefore, as we move through this digital age, we all applaud the incredibly great features of settling for this option. Going further, we shall discuss a few strong reasons that will hold the reputation of the cryptocurrency:</p>
</div>

<div class="row mt4">
	
<p><strong class="titulo-1">Great and Amazing Returns:</strong>Although cryptocurrencies have been in existence for a while now, they still have proved their ability to the world. The reason is that investing in them is the easiest way to earn skyrocketing profit quickly. Contrary to stocks that only will rise to 20$ for some years, cryptocurrency investment can easily magnify 100%. Although risks are involved, people do not get tired from diving full throttle in this investment option. However, those who invest with a winning strategy could be at the receiving end of the damage at some point.</p>
<p><strong class="titulo-1">High Volatility:</strong>You should understand that there is high volatility in cryptocurrencies. This could sound negative to the investors, but they would begin with a proper work concept before considering this choice. You should also understand how essential strategy is in the trading world. Even if you have a lot of money to invest, not without a smart strategy will cause much damage. Before you invest, you should weigh the pros and cons.</p>
<p><strong class="titulo-1">Innovation Potential:</strong>In the crypto world, there can be price change in just seconds. This means you will wake up to a new rate of cryptocurrencies every day and earn huge profits. This is why innovative minds are continually invested in developing an intelligent strategy to invest in cryptocurrencies. As we speak, many trading tools are being utilized with artificial intelligence to predict what the future holds on crypto. We are much likely to witness cryptocurrency advisory tools that will save time and suggest the best time to invest in the future. Today, if you surf the web, you will find many tools that work as a catalyst to speed up the process. </p>

	ABOUT DAO DOW7COIN
</h1>


<div class="container mt-4">
	
	<p>
		The future of work is digital. With the advent of DAO, anyone can start the work of the digital community anytime, anywhere. Our strategy to solve the problem using the tools of the market and technology allows a new model, the creation and democratization of wealth, born with a token that will later become a cryptocurrency under its protocol. This new protocol guarantees the diversification of investment based on a network and applications such as electronic contracts, financial services, communication, and especially projection through high level decentralize encryption system.
		
	</p>

	<p>
		Decentralized blockchain technology allows the elimination of intermediaries, erases the borders and cumbersome processes of traditional banking. It is a technology that consists of three fundamental components.
	</p>
	<ul style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
		<li>A transaction.</li>
		<li>A record of transactions.</li>
		<li>A system that verifies and stores the transaction.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The blocks are generated through open-source software and record information about when and in what sequence the transaction took place. This ‘block’ chronologically stores information on all the transactions that take place in the chain. Hence, the name blockchain is a database with stamped and immutable time information of each transaction replicated on servers around the world. This technology is the basis of bitcoin, a cryptographic currency, the most famous and strongest virtual currency or cryptocurrency. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The Blockchain system is therefore based on a network of nodes, that is, a decentralized network of nodes (virtual machines with direct connection input/output or physical hosts) equal connected between which the information is distributed, and, since there is no central entity, it is the same network that verifies the transactions that are executed. 
	</p>

</div>

<div class="container mt-4">
	
	<h1 class="text-center titulo-1">WITH DOW7COIN, YOU STAND A CHANCE TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF CRYPTOCURRENCY CONTINUALLY.</h1>

	<p>
		This System makes transactions and how they are executed, a key factor of it. In addition, transactions do not have to be only economical. In the blockchain system, you can make contracts, register goods and properties, have individual ownership of objects in a virtual game or society, and other exciting uses. While understanding the power of the decentralized or distributed network, shown below, having a more significant number of nodes (junction points) is more secure, fast in its communications, and immutable.

	</p>


	<p>
		The solution with Dow7Coin Token: We create wealth together by purchasing the Dow7Coin and the financial products and projects created on the platform: A friendly platform that finances development, social, production, ecological, educational projects, and so on. With the selection of profitable projects in which an investment is made, equity obtained guarantees a minimum return of 13% yearly in 3-year compound interest, which exceeds 44% of the capital and guarantees a high and constant profit to the investor.


	</p>

	<p>
		Compared with the high speculative profit of the crypto market, the proposal might seem unattractive. However, the profit of more than 44% can be 200, 300, 400%, or more and without the risk of losing everything like the “trading” in crypto market due to speculation, volatility, or manipulation of whales.

	</p>

	<p>
		This token is beneficial for entrepreneurs, workers, farmers, companies, etc., and even decentralized governments, municipalities and states, that modernize and adapt to this proposal.

		HOW DOES IT WORK?
	</h1>

	<div class="row mt-4">
		<div class="col ">

			<p>Dow7Coin is a platform for financing projects based on Blockchain and has a Token (cryptocurrency) called DOW7. The creation and democratization of wealth are possible; the secret is to invest in profitable, disruptive, innovative, and technological projects that, beyond their capitalization, increase their value several times, from their inception to consolidation, obtaining high profitability.</p>

			<p>The value of DOW7 grows with the projects, and this is added to the ROI of each company, an undertaking that gives value in the creation of wealth and its democratization.</p>

			<p>
				The projects applied on the platform are qualified through an automated system that simplifies the process; thus, granting a higher classification according to various parameters, jobs, technology, social and environmental impact, benefit to society and return on investment.

		<p>
			<strong>Facebook</strong> was born in 2003 with a site called Facemash and with a capital of  $ 1,000 loaned by its partner and roommate, 2004 it received the first investment of $ 500,000.00  for 10% of  the shares,  and the growth it has experienced throughout this time has led him to be a unicorn, Microsoft buys 1.6% of Facebook for $ 240,000.00 million, Facebook hit a $1 trillion valuation for the first time on Monday after an antitrust court victory. A US judge dismissed two lawsuits lodged against Facebook by the FTC and state attorneys general. The social-media giant is the youngest of five US companies to reach the trillion-dollar milestone. 

		</p>
	</div>	
	<p><strong>Kushki,</strong>  founded in March 2015, an Ecuadorian digital payment media startup, is currently considered a technology giant. At the beginning of June 2021 raised $ 84 M (accumulated) and now has a valuation of $ 600 million. High profitability occurs in the value of companies, so how are companies valued? The companies are valued in part by their capital to add the business model, technology, patents, brand, franchises.

<h1 class="titulo-1 mt-4">
	
	YES! YOUR PROJECT CAN BE ENHANCED AS WELL 
</h1>
<p>
	
	Dow7Coin holders can exchange their tokens for goods and services or participate in the projects and monetize their tokens in the crypto market worldwide. The more Dow7Coin grows organically and finances projects, the more value it acquires; let's look at another example: A professional acquires Dow7Coin as an investment for the future, it grows as companies produce and pay dividends, but professionals, artisans, and people in general also provide goods and services, the projects supported by Dow7Coin may be adapted in Limited Companies and Corporations that are subsequently listed on the local, regional and international stock markets according to their volume. 
</p>
<p>
	
	The goal is to democratize wealth and distribute it through stocks, profits, goods, and services using decentralized technology backed by Dow7Coin. The proposal solves a problem, not only of financing for projects and vulnerable sectors (where intermediaries are the ones who obtain the greatest profit to the detriment of those who generate the wealth) but providing liquidity to entrepreneurs who pay services in a community of providers who receive Dow7coin.
</p>

<p>
	For this, our website indicates how to apply for projects, which will be evaluated and nominated to be voted online, and those who acquire their tokens decide what to invest in.

  <h1 class="titulo-1 text-center mt-4">  How Users Increase Crypto Value & Proposal</h1>
  <p>There are also a few methods how users increase cryptocurrency value in the market:</p>
  <p>Buy low, sell high – using the classic investment strategy, users can increase the value of crypto by buying and holding coins. The buying increases demand and hence crypto value increases. <br> Increasing utility – as more institutions invest in crypto and accept it as a form of payment,  its utility increases. As a user, you can contribute to this process. This will increase the value of cryptocurrencies over the long term. </p>
  <p>
  	How does cryptocurrency gain value? <br>
    Like any currency, cryptocurrencies gain their value based on the scale of community involvement. Cryptocurrency gains value if the demand for it is higher than the supply. When a cryptocurrency is useful, people want to own more of it, driving up the demand. Since people want to use it, they don’t want to sell it. This means there is more demand than supply and the value increases.
  </p>

  <p>In addition to all this, which is basic, dow7 increases its value by the ROI of the projects, by returning the fees for transfers to the pool, by reinvesting profits in the value of the companies creating a commodity factor, using the tools of the stock market For diversification, with these strategies the value of the token increases exponentially.</p>


  <h1 class="titulo-1 text-center mt-4">  How Users Increase Crypto Value & Proposal</h1>

  <p>Blockchain allows not only decentralization and automatization, but it also allows democratization, and this is applied in Dao Dow7 in the following way: once the 3 stages of token sales have passed:</p>
  <p>DAOs need a combination of soft and hard consensus unless they want to get bogged with bureaucracy (only hard) or divisiveness (only soft). In fact, consensus mechanisms can have both “softness” and “hardness” both. Private sale 1 on February 17, 2022, private sale 2 on March 17, 2022, and public sale on April 17, 2022, the token is on the market, to finance projects these are by vote and the tokens are deposited in a pool in which there are 2 factors of profit the ROI by APY and each project increase the valuation of the companies,  the creation, and democratization of wealth. A unique stacking, earn, and holding system with constant solid growth to more than exponential growth A project returns the investment (ROI) for its profits, but these are multiplied exponentially by its valuation, Dow7 is accepted by companies as a digital asset, as the utility can buy shares in the projects, which creates equity.</p>
